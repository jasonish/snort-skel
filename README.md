Skeleton SNORT(R) Configs
=========================

Skeleton Snort configurations are the minimal amount of configuration
files required to run Snort without any rules.  These are seeded from
the tarball for the specific version of Snort then periodically
updated against http://labs.snort.org/snort/.
